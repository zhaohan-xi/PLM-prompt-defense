1,the touch buttons are textured so that your finger sdon 't slip which was very thoughtful .
1,"still , at least from my perspective , a great camera for the money , and i 'm a happy camper ! ."
1, 
1,"in conclusion , i gave the ipod a 4/5 because anything this expensive should would work just about flawlessly ."
1,8 . connected the phone to my tablet pc and now can access company von at 56k speed via bluetooth .
1,"other than that , the simian series 60 os is great and offers lots of proprietary software that will work on your phone if you 're willing to hunt for it ."
1,"strong points : - design : small , comfortable , curved , and stylish ."
1,"it doesn 't stink , ever ( like some have assumed since it doesn 't wrap each diaper into its own neat little cocoon ) ."
1,"all the "" cool "" features of the mini , but with 20gb instead of 5 ."
1,"it is heavy enough to make it stable , but not too heavy to preclude hand use ."
1,"this is my fourth linksys product and , aside from the rough start , i 'm very satisfied with this router ."
1,it has all the features one would need in a cellphone .
1,"i love all of the features , and presets as well ."
1,"if you have to buy a camera on a bu get , this has got to be the one ."
1,they also sound excellent compared to other earbuds including retail sets like panasonic's and sennheisers .
1,i have not had any distortion problems with this phone and am more pleased with this phone than any i 've used before .
0,norton support is completely pathetic .
0,on occasion i 'm not able to connect to the phone with isync via bluetooth but i found that rebooting the phone seems to solve this problem .
0,i could hardly use it without a recharge in 2 days ! .
0,"there is also no voice recording , something most if not all mp3 players have that the ipod doesn 't ."
0,and the battery life is bad ! .
0,"in noisy environment , it 's hard to hear from the earpiece ."
0,but i had to give you four because the service for my brand-new ipod was terribly slow .
0,long reboots due to norton taking forever to boot .
0,"also , not liking the gel case ."
0,the vibrate setting is loud ! .
0,"some of the higher pitched rings are very easy to hear , but not easy to listen to ."
0,only con i can think of is no camera . . . .
0,"i must have heard this about a dozen times over the span of 2 weeks , when t-zones never worked ."
0,"of course , if you try to reach symantec customer service you get useless automated systems unless you want to pay $30 per incident ."
0,do not buy any home version of norton anything .
0,these people takes lest effort to process rebate forms .
1,the nokia 6600 is a decent extension of the smart phone line .
1,"the 4300 is a very durable , compact package , and i find nikon to be a brand that i can trust ."
1,"decent battery -- on the average size , but the 40gb comes with a dock ."
1,it is small enough to fit easily in a coat pocket or purse .
1,"it 's easy to use ( just a flip of the lid , and the diaper is gone ! . ) ."
1,we lysol the champ every time we change the bag out and have not had any problems .
1,"the auto-focus performs well , but i love having the 12 optional scene modes - they are dummy-proof , and correspond to many situations in which i would actually seek to use the camera ."
1,"the interface , while a bit confusing at first , is very easy to navigate after about 15 minutes ."
1,"the clarity is unbelievable , which means you can cram almost the full 2 , 5 ! ."
1,versatile and stylish .
1,can recommend the hitachi in this ergonomic arena -- at the price quoted on amazon it is a bargain .
1,1 ) great audio quality overall .
1,this phone is fantastic .
1,its well made and user friendly .
1,"the hitachi is made in malaya , and looked cheap compared with the makita , which is made in the usa ."
1,"i was an early purchaser of the wrt54g , and had a few problems with stability and speed - finally , the march 03 firmware update has resulted in an excellent product ! ."
0,i 'm probably the only person that dislikes the itunes software .
0,"the menu options appear one at a time , taking up the whole screen , and one has to scroll down one by one , or have memorized where they are in the menu order , to select them by using the number keypad ."
0,the other annoyance with this that you have to remove every single remnant of previous version of norton systemworks before you installs this .
0,"if there were any complaints i have , they are marginal , but one is apples ' proprietary set-up for music files , their incompatibility with other music services ( i . e . napster ) is down right wrong ."
0,its quiet .
0,the only con i can think of is the lack of a mega-pixel camera .
0,i will say that the os that the phone runs does have a few issues .
0,"it 's important that people know the following : first , the interface is slow ."
0,"finally , after about a week 's use , the screen started to freeze on me ."
0,it 's a rip off if one buys norton internet security and antivirus .
0,my old sony ericsson t610 has this feature .
0,"then when i went to norton 's website to obtain a priority id number per the instructions i had been given , i couldn 't find a way to get one ."
0,it would not hang up on calls .
0,only if we could get one camera in it . .
0,this product is absolutely not ready for release .
0,"it also has a stock tracking app built in ( also useless ) and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics ( currency , length , area , etc ) ."
1,"i love the continuous shot mode , which allows you to take up to 16 pix in rapid succession -- great for action shots ."
1,the m12v has been great .
1,"and , with the ipods ' full volume up , all you have to do is adjust your receivers ' volume and your set , since the ipod itself acts as a strong amp lifer of its ' own ."
1,i love the features on the ipod and the many things you can do with it .
1,"so , i was one who was ready to give it 5 stars with no complaints at all ."
1,"i thought the fm radio would not see much use with so many tracks available to me , but its great for tuning in to tv programs at the gym while on the treadmill , concerts and programs being simulcast , npr , and on and on ."
1,"battery life keeps improving on the ipod , and a new ipod will give you up to twelve hours of play time , per charge ."
1,the interface works great .
1,i love this product ! .
1,another great feature for me anyway is the ability to load . wav sounds as ringers .
1,"the box is upstairs , and in the farthest room i get connected at 11-18m speed - that is similar to the older 10m ethernet standard ."
1,i 'm amazed at the photo quality -- prints are indistinguishable from 35mm prints .
1,"first of all , the phone houses a great deal of memory for multiple videos , sound clips , photos , texts , etc ."
1,"the ringtones are beautiful , the screen is super high quality ."
1,"also , you have to use it with itunes - or they 'll sue , dammit ! . but itunes is about as good as anything ."
1,"the sound is quite good , in terms of volume ."
0,avoid this product at all costs .
0,- no voice activated dialing ( what were they thinking
0,im at full capacity ! . ! . ! . ! . i called syman tic and they said they don 't know why but i should get tech 's support at $35/hr to help ! . ! . i did call them and was on hold for 55 minutes until i hung up ! .
0,"however , symantec has taken a significant turn for the worse with this release ."
0,"unfortunately , it does not give you the option of installing ( or installing ) them individually ."
0,"basically the 6600 is a bundle of over-hyped features you don 't and won 't need ( if you do get yourself a pda or pocket pc ) , none of them work as they should , and the basic phone functions and ergonomics are less than average ."
0,nothing spectacular is done by internet security or by antivirus software .
0,"this is only a problem at night , during the day the screen is very easy to see ."
0,the one huge disappointment is that the phones manufactured for t-mobile lack many of the menus and functions that a nokia straight from the manufacturer should have .
0,i am glad that i do not work for norton .
0,"also , their t-zones , although cheap ( $ 4 . 99 / mo . ) never works ."
0,"negative : impossibly tiny and difficult to operate , barely visible , power button ."
0,3 no voice recorder -- this has also become an important and popular feature that the ipod unfortunately doesn 't have .
0,"we can start by losing the shiny miracle-material cover that you can literally scratch just by looking at it wrong , and thus eliminate the need for third-party "" asking "" protective covers for an extra thirty bucks ."
0,"if you are new to the market and looking to buy a symantec software product , save yourself some money and buy the 2003 version ."
0,"as a loyal customer of norton/symantec products , i purchased internet security 2004 as a software firewall and could not be any more dissatisfied with the product ( and hence the one star rating ) ."
1,love the speaker phone .
1,"great camera , great investment ! ."
1,the battery recharges raul fast and the recharger thingy that comes with is real nice .
1,this one is really great .
1,"there are 3 computers in my house all getting wireless connection from this router , and everybody is happy with it ."
1,"i use it on a router table , and it is works well ."
1,all you have to do is click one button on the router configuration window and the router automatically senses the devices and configures the network .
1,sound quality ? . phenomenal .
1,i have had the ipod mini and it performs on the level with my sound card but the micro beats it outright .
1,"in conclusion , i gave the ipod a 4/5 because anything this expensive should would work just about flawlessly ."
1,"it does have a lense cap , but it wo n 't let you take pics with it on which is real good ."
1,"if you have to buy a camera on a bu get , this has got to be the one ."
1,works pretty well .
1,"there is no comparison , the champ is easy and smell free , the genie was difficult to use one handed ( which is absolutly vital if you have a little one on a changing pad ) and there was a def finite odor emanating from the genie plus we found that the quick tie garbage bags where the ties are integrated into the bag work really well because there isn 't any added bulk around the sealing edge of the champ ."
1,"its just as fast as the included creative software , but much less invasive , and overall better looking ."
1,"the battery on mine lasts 2 days if i don 't play games that much , and it only takes 90 mins to charge from flat ."
0,"basically the 6600 is a bundle of over-hyped features you don 't and won 't need ( if you do get yourself a pda or pocket pc ) , none of them work as they should , and the basic phone functions and ergonomics are less than average ."
0,the user support service isn 't too great either .
0,"1-a cell phone is to make calls , in other words , quality of reception and mic/speaker are the most important , the 6600 has a relatively low volume speaker , you 'd have to press it hard against your ear to hear anything the other person is saying , unless the surroundings were completely quiet ."
0,norton support is completely pathetic .
0,especially the bluetooth server . . . meaning you have to restart the phone if you want bluetooth to work again .
0,do not buy any home version of norton anything .
0,2- it is bulky and the small buttons on the sides are sloppy to use .
0,"i do here a constant high-pitched distorted sound , not to mention the volume does not seem to be loud enough ."
0,"during install , nis would either freeze or not reboot properly when asked to do so ."
0,is it necessary to scan my ms money database when i close the program ? .
0,"this is somewhat annoying , but from working with computers ( especially windows -- ugh . . . )"
0,i think it is a combination of the program size taking up resources and the open/close scanning that it does with every program .
0,4 ) buttons are quite small and is really a pain exp if one is fond of text messaging .
0,"the next problem was that it didn 't recognize all the installed components , so it would not update them , most notably and importantly , virus definitions ."
0,"so i e-mailed the online tech support with that simple question , and got a reply which was totally unresponsive ( it looked as though they didn 't actually read the e-mail and just sent back a few boilerplate paragraphs ) ."
0,"and , when you think about it , it 's insulting that norton requires its customers to jump through these hoops -- anyone who can provide proof of purchase , whether on the phone or online ( what if your computer is down ? . ) , should have equal priority ."
